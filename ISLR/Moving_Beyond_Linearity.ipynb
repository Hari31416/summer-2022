    "Here, we relax the linearity assumption\n",

    "such as splines, local regression, and generalized additive models.\n",

    "this can produce an extremely flexible fit.\n",
    "* **Smoothing splines** are similar to regression splines, but arise in a\n",
    "slightly different situation. Smoothing splines result from minimizing\n",
    "a residual sum of squares criterion subject to a smoothness penalty.\n",
